# Glacial-Inferno
A repo for the RCOS project Glacial Inferno, which is an open source terraria mod hosted on tmodloader

Description:

This is a mod for the game Terraria that intends to add items, enemies, tools, etc. It will be published for public use through tModLoader by the end of the project. We intend to have content implemented throughout all stages of the game and to have content aimed at improving gameplay flow and enjoyability. 

These items intend to eventually follow a theme of “fire and ice” but we are not restricting ourselves to this theme if it in any way restricts creative processes.

Overall Vision:
We want to have a new and unique overall content mod that expands lackluster parts of the game but does not only focus on such parts. Ideally, we want to have this mod be properly balanced and have fun and interesting items / gameplay that is distinct from any other mods / vanilla gameplay. Eventually, in a long time this could rival huge content mods such as calamity with the main difference being the overall focus on fire and ice.
